# Vending Machine CST-135
A shared repository for the CST-135 Milestones and Final Project

This project will provide a simple vending machine program written in Java that can handle Chips, Candy, Gum, and Drinks. Each of those items can be tracked by individual classes or by more detailed information such as Flavor, Name, Price, and Quantity. The program as a proof of concept can be run in the Eclipse IDE.
